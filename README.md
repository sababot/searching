<p align="center">Search Algorithms</p>
This is a repository containing a simple implementation of several searching algorithms which can be used to search for a number within an array. Soon, a visualization will be implemented in order to make it easy and appealing to look at. For now, this is just a cli program.

Clone this repository using:

```git clone https://github.com/sababot/searching.git```
